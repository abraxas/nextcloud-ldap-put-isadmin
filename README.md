# nextcloud-ldap-put-isadmin

**Nextcloud Server** `35.0.0` - Nextcloud GmbH

PUT `/cloud/users/{id}` lets a delegated Users admin edit a target unless that target is in the **local** group `admin`. PATCH on the same path correctly uses `isAdmin()`. LDAP-promoted admins are `isAdmin()===true` and often **not** in that local group.

**A bad actor with the helpdesk-style Users job can disable, quota-lock, or delete a real LDAP-promoted instance admin. The newer PATCH API correctly refuses. The older PUT path does not.**

## What an attacker can do

On an LDAP site, you promoted an LDAP group to instance admin (`occ ldap:promote-group`). Those people are real admins (`isAdmin()===true`) but they may **not** sit in the local Nextcloud group named `admin`.

You also gave someone the **Users** settings job (helpdesk). They are not a full instance admin.

That helpdesk user can:

- **Change quota** on the LDAP-promoted admin (lab: PUT 200, PATCH 403)
- **Disable** or **delete** that admin (same `isInGroup` gate on enable/disable/delete/wipe)
- Reset password **if** the LDAP backend allows `canChangePassword()` (often false; do not depend on it)

They cannot do this to someone who is actually in the local `admin` group. They cannot do this on a site with no LDAP-promoted admins. The safer PATCH API already knows the difference.

## How I found it

Provisioning has two editors for the same user. `UsersController::editUser` is PUT. `editUserMultiField` is PATCH. Same file. Adjacent methods. Two different answers to "is this person an admin."

PUT checks `isInGroup($target, 'admin')`. PATCH checks `isAdmin($target)`. `Manager::isAdmin()` asks LDAP `IIsAdmin` then the local group. `occ ldap:promote-group` makes an LDAP group instance-admin without putting those uids in the local `admin` group.

I stood up official `nextcloud:35.0.0-apache` plus `osixia/openldap:1.5.0`. LDAP user `ldapadmin` in promoted group `ncadmins`: `isAdmin()===true`, not in local `admin`. Local `helpdesk` is delegated Users, not instance admin.

I sent PATCH first. It is the newer route. I expected PUT to match it. PATCH `{"quota":"1 GB"}` returned **403**. PUT `key=quota&value=1 GB` returned **200**. GET then showed quota `1073741824`.

## The fix

Use `isAdmin($target)` on PUT/disable/delete/wipe the same way PATCH already does.
